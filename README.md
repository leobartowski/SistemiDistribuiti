<h3>Collection of exercises done to prepare myself for the examination of Distributed Systems.</h3>
<br>
There are two kind of exercises: 
<br>
- MPI using C
<br>
- RMI using Java
<br><br>
<b>P.S.</b> I created one project for every exercise and added a .gitignore in every project folder. It's not the best solution but it was the fastest for me.
